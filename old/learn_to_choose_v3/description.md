# reaching task 0.1

instead of pushing on a manipulandom, mice reach for lateral rewards

## 1) learn to reach
random ITI -> cue on left or right side signals reward availability

<!-- ## 2) learn to push
pushing manipulandum left or right gives reward
only one correct side, and correct at random (for future nonrandom - can be used to remove bias)

## 3) learn to push after cue
2nd timing cue - haptic buzz on the manipulandum
push to either side (as before)

present cue only after some time of immobility

## 4) learn to time
present 1st timing cue before 2nd w uniform distribution of full 3s
correct side is depending 1.5 boundary

## 5) learn to initiate
as it is now, progress into task after init -->
